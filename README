Welcome to the "MusicRecital" AppFuse Java EE Web Application
==============================================================================

If you're reading this then you've probably cloned the repository at GitHub. 
Hopefull, you have just copied the source for this application and set
up a Git repository in this directory structure. 

The application was derived-from or started with an AppFuse archetype. The
model template was a single module Tapestry framework and it uses AppFuse 3.0.0.
You will soon notice that the modelVersion tag in the project pom is 4.0.0.
This means that the Maven project model pom is using version 4.0.0 of the XSD.
The AppFuse framework version is in the properties section deep in the pom.xml.
You will find that versions of your dependencies are easily found and identified
in the Maven project object model.
 
The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml just below the 
project root directory. This file is configured to run for you locally as long
as you have running instances of the MySQL database and SMPT relay service
available and open on your local network or localhost (127.0.0.1). MySQL can be
installed easily on your development machine, however installations vary by OS
instances. MySQL installation and administration are beyond the scope of this
README but the following prerequisites are needed at a minimum:

1. Java 7.x or higher (This is going to be decided by development team)
2. Maven 3.1.0
3. MySQL 5.x

Note: MusicRecital will run in a web container as-is without SMTP but this means
that emails (a feature of this system) will not work.
  
Once, you are confident that Java, Maven, and MySQL are available, open a
terminal window and change-directory to your project clone.

1. Run "mvn jetty:run" and view the application at http://localhost:8080.

2. Please post questions for this application after subscribing to the developers

   development site is hosted here http://musicrecital.org/project/ . You can also
