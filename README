If you're reading this then you've probably cloned the repository at GitHub. 
MusicRecital.  You have just copied the source for this application and set
up a Git repository in this directory structure. 

The application was derived-from or started with an AppFuse archetype. The
model was a single module Tapestry framework and it uses AppFuse 3.0.0
 
The project object model (pom) is defined in the file pom.xml.
The application is ready to run as a web application. The pom.xml file is
pre-defined with Hibernate as a persistence model and Tapestry as the web
framework.

To get started, please complete the following steps:
