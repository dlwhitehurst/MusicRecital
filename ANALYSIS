Appfuse First
User, Admin (User with set Role)

NOTE: all users register and then provide their interest to be a part of the MusicRecital
local community.

Two paths of development first.

1. Create MusicProgram and MusicEvent
2. Survey the newly registered user and build a set of roles to match his profile.

For 1) build objects, dao and service layer, test. For 2) determine design and prototype. When complete,
wrap operations with role authorization. And, create responsibility defining positions, Director, Producer,
Performer, Accompanist, Composer, Songwriter, ...

The Roles can be part of the UI operations after the basic operations have been created and tested.
