## Master Story Listing

1. Create Coordinator (creates MusicPrograms and MusicEvents)
2. Create MusicProgram
3. Create MusicEvent

## Strategy

Create actor objects for later use.

User - Registered user 
Admin - Highest level of control over the application (User with set Role)


NOTE: all Users register and then begin provide their interest in being a part of the MusicRecital
local community. The system will determine their interests and best help them do what they want to
do where it relates to music practice and performance.

Focus on two implementation development paths.

1. Create MusicProgram and MusicEvent
2. Survey the newly registered user and build a set of roles to match his profile.

When the Coordinator is first determined, this assignment is simply the assignment of a Role. Later
as the Coordinator (role) gains experience and shows that he is fulfilling his role as a Coordinator, the
system will deem him/her to be a true Coordinator and create a Coordinator (object) in the system and this
may also open up other features of the system in the future.

When the user registers, he/she will be sent a URL in an email explaining how the system needs to best
understand their interests on MusicRecital and what Roles they would request to be assigned. The system
will have to allow all users to be assigned the roles they want. These newly authorized users will be
using the system in the manner that other web applications do, i.e. a CRUD (create, read, update, and 
delete) application will be available to them and in the capacity they expected. The true benefit of the 
application will be when their merit is granted a true place in the system. Other features will become
available and communication channels will open up for this "approved" MusicRecital member.
